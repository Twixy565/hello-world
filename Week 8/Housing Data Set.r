Cleaning df =   Looked for unique values in all columns (lat/Lon), removed any duplicates.  
Omitted all NAs, removed several columns that wouldn't help or hurt the model.  Sorted the columns to verify if the house was listed multiple times the bedrooms and bathrooms were the same unless it indicated a remodel had been done.

8b.  The F-stat is a lrg number and a p-value  less than .001.  
     The results say the sq ft of a lot can predict/affect the sale price of the home. 
8c.  Yes, square feet of total lot, bathroom, bedrooms and year built all affected the Sale price of homes. 

9.   Below is the model summary of multiple linear Reg. model.  The standardized betas for each parameter is:
    All have a positive relationship except for the bedroom count. So, as the number of bathrooms, total sq ft and 
    year built increase the Sale price could also increase, as long as the other predictors are held constant. 
    I also found that an increase in bedrooms is associated with a decrease in sale prices.  So if the total sq ft 
    of the house increase by .425 then the sale of the house will increase by 0.425 sd. Only if the the other predictors are constant.

10. Square ft total, year built and bathroom count don't cross zero thus saying that 95% of the population
    would have a true beta value.  
    Even though bathrooms has a large C.I. and the other two (sq. total and year built) have a small 
    C.I., it's still significant.  However,
    bedrooms do cross zero, this is telling me that some samples in the population will have a positive or negative relationship.  
    I can't say that 95% of the population will have a true b value.

20.  I think overall our model is slightly unbiased and does represent the general population. 
    I do feel there was some discretion with the data but would need more information concerning the data. 
    Such as several homes having 0 bedrooms (studio apt?) and homes having 0 bathrooms didn't see accurate.  
    However, without that being clear, I don't think it caused too much of an issue with the model.
